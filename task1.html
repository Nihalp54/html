    <p>Front end refers to the part of a website that users interact with directly. It involves designing and creating the user interface, ensuring that the website looks and functions well in a web browser.</p>

    <p>Backend, on the other hand, is the behind-the-scenes work that makes the front end function. It involves server-side scripting, database management, and ensuring that data is processed and delivered to the front end as needed.</p>
